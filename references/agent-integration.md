# Agent Integration Guide

## Supported Agents

| Agent | Config File | Skill Directory | Agent Name |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| Hermes Agent | `~/.hermes/SOUL.md` | `~/.hermes/skills/devops/toolscout/` | `hermes` |
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | `~/.claude/skills/toolscout/` | `claude-code` |
| Codex | `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` | `~/.codex/skills/toolscout/` | `codex` |

## Shared Rules

All agents must:

1. Use the default shared file-based runtime tool-memory home:
   `~/.config/toolscout/tool-memory`.
2. Treat `TOOLSCOUT_MEMORY_HOME` as an optional explicit override only.
3. Not create private, agent-specific, or alternate authority-specific
   tool-memory during normal installation.
4. Not treat tool-memory as authoritative enterprise knowledge or history.
5. Not create a second high-authority tool inventory.
6. Not copy full SKILL.md into another governance store.

Every record written by an agent must include `source_agent` identifying
which agent wrote it.

## Installation (All Agents)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/licat233/toolscout.git
cd toolscout
cargo build --release
cp target/release/toolscout /usr/local/bin/

# Verify
toolscout doctor
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `TOOLSCOUT_MEMORY_HOME` | Optional override for the default tool-memory home |
| `TOOLSCOUT_MEMORY_CONFIG` | Override config file location |
| `TOOLSCOUT_AGENT_NAME` | Agent name for records (`hermes`, `claude-code`, `codex`) |

```bash
export TOOLSCOUT_AGENT_NAME="claude-code"

# Optional custom path only:
# export TOOLSCOUT_MEMORY_HOME="/path/to/tool-memory"
# launchctl setenv TOOLSCOUT_MEMORY_HOME "/path/to/tool-memory"
```

## Hermes Agent

Add the ToolScout Rule to `~/.hermes/SOUL.md`.
See `references/soul-rule-integration.md` for the full rule text.

Optionally configure MCP in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`.
See `references/mcp-integration.md` for the config snippet.

## Claude Code

Add the ToolScout Rule to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
See `references/claude-code-integration.md` for the full rule text.

## Codex

Add the ToolScout Rule to your Codex agent configuration:

```markdown
## ToolScout Rule

Do not invoke toolscout at task start. Invoke it only immediately before
writing incidental code that would reimplement a commodity local operation, or
before installing a dependency for that operation. Using terminal or another
basic shell tool by itself is not a trigger.

Do not run it for ordinary software development, conversation, explanations,
planning, code reading/review, repository inspection, or an already-selected tool.

1. For an in-scope operation run:
   `toolscout advise --task "<operation>" --intent avoid_custom_code --category <category> --json`
2. If the decision is `use_existing_tool`, use the recommended tool before
   writing custom code.
3. If the decision is `verify_recalled_recipe`, re-detect the tool and reuse the
   remembered command if still valid.
4. Recall tool-memory only when candidates are unavailable or failed.
5. Write code when the user requested an implementation, custom logic is
   required, or no suitable mature tool is available.

If writing code, briefly state why: "No existing tool fits because …"

tool-memory is shared runtime infrastructure, not authoritative enterprise knowledge or history.
Do not create private tool-memory when TOOLSCOUT_MEMORY_HOME exists.
SKILL.md is the sole execution rule source.
```

## Post-Installation Report

After installation, report:

- Which agent was configured
- Where toolscout was installed
- Which tool-memory path is being used
- Whether `TOOLSCOUT_MEMORY_HOME` is unset or intentionally overriding the default
- Whether `.tool-memory-home` marker exists
- Any legacy or conflicting tool-memory paths found
- Which agent config file was updated

  Relevant ONLY immediately before writing incidental custom code for a
  commodity local operation, or installing a utility/dependency for it.
  Using terminal by itself is not a trigger. Not relevant to chat, planning,
  reflection, Memory/Skill/Ledger persistence, review, or inspection.

# ToolScout

Use this skill when the user asks to convert formats, extract data, batch-process
files, transform JSON/CSV/XML/SQLite, work with PDF/Office documents, process
images/audio/video, compress archives, install a utility, or write a custom
script for a task that may already have a local tool.

Do not use this skill for normal chat, explanations, planning, code review,
reading source files, summarizing a repository, or basic inspection commands
such as `rg`, `sed`, `cat`, `ls`, and `git status`.

## Architecture

toolscout = Rust runtime core + SKILL.md rule layer + shared file-based tool-memory

## Core Rule

Do not invoke toolscout at task start. Invoke it immediately before an agent
would write incidental code that reimplements a commodity local operation, or
before installing a tool or dependency for that operation.

1. **Check relevant skills first** — a dedicated skill outranks this general gate.
2. Skip toolscout for ordinary software development, conversation, explanation,
   planning, code reading/review, and already-selected tools.
3. For an in-scope operation, run:
   `toolscout advise --task "<operation>" --intent avoid_custom_code --category <category> --json`
4. If the decision is `use_existing_tool`, use it instead of writing incidental code.
5. If the decision is `verify_recalled_recipe`, re-detect the recalled tool.
6. If the decision is `known_tool_not_installed`, ask before installing it.
7. Write code when the task requires custom business logic, the user explicitly
   requested an implementation, or no suitable mature tool is available.
8. Record only verified tool success, failure, or unsafe patterns.

The runtime checks the registry and current tool availability first. It recalls
category-scoped tool-memory only when no registered candidate is currently
available, or when the caller explicitly passes `--recall`.

Do not perform blind filesystem scans. Do not run `find /`, `find ~`, or scan every
executable on the machine.

## tool-memory Is Shared Runtime Infrastructure

tool-memory stores tool availability, verified command recipes, failed attempts,
blocked command patterns, and environment-specific operational notes.

It is **not** current truth. It is **not** user-approved long-term memory. It is **not**
a replacement for governed enterprise knowledge/history authorities. It must **not** be promoted into high-authority
memory automatically.

All agents (Codex, Claude Code, Hermes) share one canonical runtime tool-memory home.
Each record includes `source_agent` to identify which agent wrote it.

## Tool-Memory Home

Default path:

```text
~/.config/toolscout/tool-memory
```

Use this default for normal installation, including non-Obsidian and Obsidian
users. Do not ask the user to choose a tool-memory location unless they
explicitly request a custom path or migration from an old path.

Resolution priority:
1. `TOOLSCOUT_MEMORY_HOME` env var, only when intentionally set as an override
2. `memory_home` key in `~/.config/toolscout/config.yaml`
3. `file.base_dir` in config
4. Default: `~/.config/toolscout/tool-memory`

If `TOOLSCOUT_MEMORY_HOME` is set, all agents use it as the canonical home.
Do not create private tool-memory elsewhere. Do not silently fall back while it exists.

See `references/memory-home-resolution.md` for the full resolution rules.

## Tool Memory Storage

toolscout uses a file-based shared tool-memory store.

One record per JSON file, append-only, atomic writes (`.tmp` + rename).

```text
<tool-memory-home>/
  .tool-memory-home              # canonical marker
  records/
    20260612-153000-hermes-pandoc-recipe-8f3a.json
    20260612-153102-claude-code-ffmpeg-media-a92d.json
```

Database adapters are intentionally not supported in the baseline design for:
- lower maintenance cost
- safer multi-agent writes
- easier manual inspection
- simple default installation across agents
- better Git backup and diff
- simpler migration
- no database locking issues

See `references/tool-memory-format.md` for the full record schema.

## Multi-Agent Sharing

Rules:
- Agents may share tool-memory.
- Agents may **not** create private tool-memory or alternate authority-specific homes during
  normal installation.
- Agents may **not** treat tool-memory as current truth.
- Agents may **not** use another agent's execution record as approved SOP.
- If a tool recipe should become a formal rule, create a proposal or update SKILL.md
  through normal project maintenance.

Each record must include `source_agent` (`hermes`, `claude-code`, `codex`).

## Rust Runtime CLI

Build: `cargo build --release`

```bash
# Resolve the canonical memory home
toolscout advise --task "<operation>" --intent avoid_custom_code --category image --json
toolscout memory resolve --json

# Initialize the resolved memory home only after explicit intent
toolscout memory init --json

# Query the registry for candidate tools
toolscout registry query --category document --json
toolscout registry query --task "extract docx text" --json

# Detect which candidate tools are installed
toolscout tools detect --category document --json

# Persist availability records when detection should be retained
toolscout tools detect --category document --record --json

# Recall past experience from tool-memory
toolscout memory recall --task "extract docx text" --json

# Record a tool experience
toolscout memory record '{"record_type":"recipe","category":"document","tool":"pandoc","task":"extract_text_from_docx","status":"verified_success","command_template":"pandoc {input} -t plain","source_agent":"claude-code"}' --json

# Check for memory home conflicts
toolscout memory check-conflicts --json

# Run diagnostics
toolscout doctor

# Start MCP server
toolscout mcp serve
```

### MCP Tools

| MCP Tool | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `advise_tool_use` | Check for a mature tool before incidental code reimplements a commodity operation |
| `resolve_memory_home` | Resolve the canonical tool-memory home |
| `query_registry` | Find candidate tools by category/task |
| `detect_candidates` | Detect which tools are installed |
| `recall_memory` | Search retained tool-memory |
| `record_memory` | Persist a tool experience record |
| `check_conflicts` | Check for multiple memory home candidates |
| `doctor` | Run diagnostic checks |

## Categories

- `document`: Word, Markdown, HTML, EPUB, Office-like extraction/conversion
- `pdf`: PDF text extraction, metadata, rendering, split/merge
- `image`: image conversion, resize, OCR, metadata
- `media`: audio/video conversion, compression, probing
- `data`: JSON, YAML, CSV, TSV, XML, SQLite
- `search`: text search, file finding, fuzzy filtering
- `archive`: zip, tar, gzip, zstd, lz4, xz, 7z
- `dev`: git, language runtimes, package managers, build/test helpers
- `web`: curl-like access, web search/scraping/browser automation
- `ai`: local LLMs, coding agents, memory tools

## Decision Rules

Priority order (highest first):

1. **Skill covers the task** — load and follow the skill.
2. **Existing tool solves it** — use the tool for standard format conversion, text extraction, search/filter/transform, compression, media conversions, or one-shot inspection.
3. **Write code** — for multi-step workflows with state, business-specific rules, complex parsing, error recovery, or when skills and tools both fail.

If writing code, state the reason briefly: "Existing tools do not fit because ...".

## Prohibited Behaviors

- Do not blindly scan the entire filesystem (`find /`, `find ~`).
- Do not create private tool-memory when `TOOLSCOUT_MEMORY_HOME` exists.
- Do not write LLM guesses as `verified_success` tool-memory.
- Do not treat tool-memory as enterprise knowledge or history authority.
- Do not automatically promote tool-memory into WeKnora or EAO Ledger.
- Do not create a second high-authority tool inventory or copy the full SKILL.md
  into another governance store.
- Do not write hallucinated or guessed tool-memory records.
- Only write tool-memory records after actual detection or execution.

## Agent Integration

This skill supports multiple AI agents. See `references/agent-integration.md` for
the unified guide.

- **Hermes**: Add ToolScout Rule to `~/.hermes/SOUL.md` (see `references/soul-rule-integration.md`).
- **Claude Code**: Add ToolScout Rule to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (see `references/claude-code-integration.md`).
- **Codex**: Add ToolScout Rule to your Codex agent config (see `references/agent-integration.md`).

## Pitfalls

- **Agent-specific rule required for auto-activation.** The skill ships as a passive reference — it only triggers when explicitly loaded or when a matching rule exists. For Hermes, add a SOUL.md rule. For Claude Code, add a CLAUDE.md rule.
- **Default memory home first.** Use `~/.config/toolscout/tool-memory` unless
  `TOOLSCOUT_MEMORY_HOME` is intentionally set as an override.
- **Workspace vs installed copy.** If you develop in a separate workspace, remember to sync changes to the installed location:
  - Hermes: `cp -r . ~/.hermes/skills/devops/toolscout/`
  - Claude Code: `cp -r . ~/.claude/skills/toolscout/`
  - Codex: `cp -r . ~/.codex/skills/toolscout/`
- **macOS GUI apps** may not inherit shell environment variables. Use `launchctl setenv TOOLSCOUT_MEMORY_HOME "/path/to/tool-memory"`.
- **Path migration verification.** After changing any config path: run `toolscout doctor` and `toolscout memory check-conflicts --json`.
